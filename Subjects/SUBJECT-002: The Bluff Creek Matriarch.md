## 2. SUBJECT OVERVIEW
Subject-002 refers to the specific female Hominid captured on 16mm film on October 20, 1967. This remains the Bureau's most analyzed piece of visual evidence. Unlike other sightings, Subject-002 displayed a calm, non-aggressive retreat, suggesting a high level of intelligence and familiarity with human presence in the perimeter.

## 3. BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
* **Locomotion:** Distinct "compliant gait" with a bent-knee stride. The mid-tarsal break in the foot is clearly visible in the plaster casts recovered from the site.
* **Anatomy:** Heavy sagittal crest and prominent breasts, confirming the subject was a nursing female at the time of the encounter.
* **Coat:** Uniform reddish-brown hair covering the entire body, except for the face, palms, and soles.

## 4. TRACKING ANALYSIS
> **Warning:** The Bluff Creek area has since been heavily disturbed by human activity.

1.  **Gait Analysis:** Subject-002 covered ground much faster than an average human. Do not attempt to pursue on foot in mountainous terrain.
2.  **Detection:** In 1967, no thermal equipment was available. Modern agents are advised to scan for "Thermal Shadows" behind large Redwoods where this subject was known to hide.

## 5. CONSERVATION STATUS: CR (Critically Endangered)
No sightings of this specific individual or its direct offspring have been confirmed in the Bluff Creek area since the mid-1980s. The Bureau fears that habitat loss and illegal logging in the Six Rivers National Forest have pushed this population to local extinction.
