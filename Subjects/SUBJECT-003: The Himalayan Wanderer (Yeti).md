**STATUS:** VU (Vulnerable) / High Altitude Specialist

## 1. DATA VISUALIZATION

> **Field Record:** Reconstructed footprint analysis from the 1951 Shipton Expedition. Unlike the Bluff Creek subject, the Yeti displays a wider toe splay for snow traction.

## 2. SUBJECT OVERVIEW
Subject-003, commonly known as the **Yeti** or **Meh-Teh**, is a relic hominid adapted for survival in extreme sub-zero temperatures. Bureau data suggests these subjects reside in the "Death Zone" (above 8,000 meters) during summer and migrate to the tree line (sub-alpine forests) during winter for food.

## 3. BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
* **Pelage:** Thick, dual-layered fur. Inner layer for heat retention; outer layer is oily and water-repellent to prevent ice buildup.
* **Coloration:** Varies from slate grey to snowy white, providing perfect camouflage in rock and ice fields.
* **Metabolism:** Extremely low. The subject can remain stationary for days, mimicking a rock formation to conserve energy.

## 4. FIELD MANUAL: MOUNTAIN TRACKING
> **Mandatory:** Oxygen tanks and specialized climbing gear are required for this hunt.

1.  **Thermal Contrast:** In the snow, a Yeti stands out significantly on thermal scanners. However, the cold air can cause "Thermal Mirages." Always verify with high-zoom optics.
2.  **Audio Warning:** The Yeti's call is a high-pitched whistle that can be mistaken for the wind. If the whistle is rhythmic, the subject is communicating with others.
3.  **DNA Collection:** Scat samples found at these altitudes are often preserved by the ice. Collect frozen samples only with insulated, sterile tongs to avoid "Thermal Contamination" from your hands.

## 5. CONSERVATION STATUS: VU (Vulnerable)
While the Yeti population is protected by the sheer inaccessibility of its habitat, melting glaciers and increasing mountaineering tourism are forcing the subjects into lower, more populated valleys. The Bureau classifies this as a "Vulnerable" species due to its low reproductive rate.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *Local monks at the Pangboche monastery once claimed to possess a Yeti scalp. While later analyzed as serow hide, the Bureau maintains that the 'True Yeti' avoids religious structures and human contact at all costs. They are the ghosts of the peaks.*
