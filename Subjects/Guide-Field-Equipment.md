# BUREAU FIELD GUIDE: TRACKING GEAR & DETECTION

**DOCUMENT TYPE:** TECHNICAL MANUAL / ADVISORY
**VERSION:** 2013.8 (CRYPTO-REVISION)
**CLEARANCE:** ALL FIELD AGENTS

## 1. THE "BIGFOOT OUTSIDER" SCAM
The Bureau warns all initiates against "Bigfoot Calling Apps" or cheap "Ultrasonic Repellents" found on the market. Most commercial "Sasquatch Calls" are simply distorted bear or elk recordings that will, at best, attract nothing and, at worst, lure a hungry Grizzly to your position. 

To track a Hominid (Class-IV Cryptid), you don't need toys; you need **forensic-grade** collection tools and **long-range** observation gear.

## 2. RECOMMENDED GEAR (FIELD ANALOGS)

### A. The "Wood-Knocker" (Communication)
Do not buy plastic "clappers." A real tracker uses natural resonance.
* **The Gear:** A 2-foot section of seasoned **Hickory or Oak**.
* **Usage:** Striking a hollow Cedar or Fir tree. This mimics the territorial "knock" used by Bigfoot. 
* **Pro-Tip:** Listen for the "Echo-Return." If the response is faster than 2 seconds or from a different elevation, it is likely another tracker or a bird. Real Hominid responses are heavy and resonant.

### B. Thermal & Night Vision
Bigfoot is primarily nocturnal or crepuscular. Standard flashlights will only spook them or cause "Eye-Shine" that is easily confused with deer.
* **Recommendation:** **FLIR Scout TK** or **PVS-14 Night Vision**.
* **Why:** You are looking for "Heat Signatures" in dense brush. Bigfoot fur is highly insulative, but their face, armpits, and groin leak heat. A thermal camera will reveal a 800lb mammal hiding in a thicket where your eyes see only shadows.

### C. Casting Kits (Forensics)
Photos of footprints are rarely accepted as proof. You need physical depth.
* **Recommendation:** **Dental Stone** (not Plaster of Paris).
* **Why:** Plaster of Paris is too brittle and shrinks. Dental Stone (used by dentists and CSI) is extremely hard and captures microscopic dermal ridges (fingerprints on the feet).
* **The Test:** If the print doesn't show "Mid-Tarsal Break" (a flex in the middle of the foot), it is likely a fake wooden-foot print.

### D. Audio Traps (Bioacoustics)
Smartphone microphones cannot capture "Infrasound" (frequencies below 20Hz).
* **Recommendation:** **Wildlife Acoustics SM4** or **Zoom H2n** with a parabolic dish.
* **Setting:** Record in **WAV (96kHz/24-bit)**. 
* **The "Infrasound" Factor:** Many witnesses report feeling "paralyzed" or "dread" before a sighting. This is caused by infrasound emitted by the creature. Only high-end recorders can prove this exists.

## 3. POPULATION & CONSERVATION STATUS
When filing a report, you must categorize the subject's local status:
* **Level: LC (Least Concern)** - Frequent sightings, stable food source (e.g., Olympic Peninsula).
* **Level: NT (Near Threatened)** - Encroaching urban development; sightings moving to higher elevations.
* **Level: CR (Critically Endangered)** - Isolated pockets (e.g., Florida Skunk Ape), high risk of local extinction.

## 4. PRO-TIPS FOR REALISTIC TRACKING
1.  **The "Scat" Rule:** If you find hair or waste, do not touch it with bare hands. Use a sterile bag. Human DNA contamination ruins the sample for the Bureau lab.
2.  **Debunk First:** 95% of "vocalizations" are actually Barred Owls, Coyotes, or Fox screams. If it sounds like a woman screaming, it’s a Cougar. If it sounds like a demonic wood-chipper, it might be a Bigfoot.
3.  **Baseline:** Know the local wildlife. If you don't know what a Black Bear looks like at 2:00 AM through a thermal lens, you shouldn't be in the woods.

> **ARCHIVIST NOTE:** *The Sasquatch is a master of its environment. It has lived in these woods for millennia without being caught by 'modern' man. Respect the silence. If the forest suddenly goes quiet (The "Silent Zone"), something is watching you. Verify the heat signature, then back away slowly.*
